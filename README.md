# OsuLoader

_A C# library for loading .osu files and managing content._

## Introduction
If you're wondering about features... There is a lack of them.

This library was created to load .osu files and manage their content from a C# application. _**8 years ago.**_

I was a beginner in C# compared to now. But hey, why not actually improve this?

I'm going over what code is here in the next days and see what I can improve/implement.

I'll also edit this README file with proper instructions on how to use this library and the CHANGELOG file with the changes I've made.
